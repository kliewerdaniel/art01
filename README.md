## MVP Workflow

1. **Mentor Onboarding**  
   Create profile, add participants.  

2. **Participant Onboarding**  
   Log basic info, skills, goals, receive initial resources.  

3. **Task & Feedback Cycle**  
   Mentor assigns tasks → participant submits projects → mentor provides structured feedback.  

4. **Project Marketplace**  
   Participants list projects for sale; mentor tracks payments.  

5. **Progress Dashboard**  
   Visualize skill improvement, earnings, milestone goals.  

6. **Portfolio Integration**  
   Auto-generate static site for portfolio/blog.

## App Architecture

[MENTORS] <—> [PARTICIPANTS] <—> [SKILLS/PROJECTS] <—> [MARKETPLACE/PORTFOLIO]
\                          
\                          -> [RESOURCES/TOOLS]

-> [TASKS/FEEDBACK]

-> [PROGRESS DASHBOARD / GOALS]

-> [PAYMENTS & SAVINGS]

### Data Flow
1. Mentor onboards participant → assigns skills/resources → sets milestones  
2. Participant completes tasks → submits projects → receives mentor feedback  
3. Marketplace listing and payment processing  
4. Static portfolio generation  
5. Financial & progress dashboards  
6. Community features for feedback and collaboration  

### Frontend ↔ Backend Flow
- React/Next.js: dashboards, tasks, projects, marketplace, portfolios  
- Django REST: authentication, CRUD APIs, payments, feedback storage, portfolio generation  
- PostgreSQL: relational data with seed data for testing

## ER Diagram Overview

[eb2822f18a7feb8eb2359d0b6623e98f757480a62ba0895f3752102fbbc390a8.png]

**Entities & Relationships**
- Users: Mentor ↔ Participants, multiple Tasks & Projects  
- Skills: Many-to-many with Users via `UserSkills`  
- Resources: Assigned to Participants, optionally linked to Skills  
- Tasks: Mentor assigns to Participant → Skill  
- Feedback: Linked to Tasks  
- Projects: Owned by Participants → listed in Marketplace  
- Marketplace: Tracks sales, buyer info  
- Financial Accounts: Tracks earnings, savings, milestones  
- Portfolio: Static site per Participant showcasing Projects  

---

## Next Steps

1. Draw ER diagram (tables & relationships)  
2. Define API endpoints:
   - `POST /participants`  
   - `POST /tasks`  
   - `POST /projects`  
   - `POST /feedback`  
   - `GET /dashboard`  
   - `POST /marketplace/sell`  
3. Design portfolio templates  
4. Prototype MVP workflow:
   - Mentor adds participant → assigns skill → tracks tasks → uploads projects → sells project → tracks earnings → milestone rewards
